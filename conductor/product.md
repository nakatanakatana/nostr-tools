# Initial Concept
Development of a suite of tools to easily and securely build and operate external services such as Nostr relays and NIP-05.

# Product Vision
Provide relay hosting tools and utilities that are easy to deploy and meet high security standards for administrators and developers supporting the Nostr ecosystem infrastructure.

# Target Users
- **Relay Administrators**: Individuals or organizations who want to easily host and operate their own relays or NIP-05 services.
- **Nostr Developers**: Developers who need libraries or CLI tools to streamline the implementation or integration of the protocol.

# Core Features
- **Nostr Relay Hosting**: Functions for relay deployment and configuration management.
- **NIP-05 Service**: Functions to host and provide identifier authentication via NIP-05 externally.
- **Deployment Support**: Provision of a simple deployment process using single binaries or Docker.

# Success Criteria
- **Ease of Deployment**: Being able to run relays and related services in a few steps without complex configuration.
- **Security**: Protecting services from malicious input or attacks through strict validation and appropriate rate limiting.
